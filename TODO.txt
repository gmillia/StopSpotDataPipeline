goal: Update Checkpointer/main.py with the changes made by processed_days.py in mind.

1) Remove checkpoint.py, the table processed_days makes it obsolete.

2) To preserve the ability to re/run based off checkpoints, update main.py to be a class Client.
        Notably, it should have process_since_checkpoint() and process_next_day().
a) Helpful code:
    df = processed_days.get_full_table()
    df.index.max() # get the most future processed day.
