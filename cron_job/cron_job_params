# * * * * * command

# A little explanation of the below command. This will create and run a new container in the background with the stop_spot image. 
# Once the container finishes its job the container will stop and delete the container. Within the Dockerfile the default command
# is to run the application with the --daily flag and so this command will process the next days data at 4am everyday by default.

# For this line:
# --mount type=bind,source=/home/pipeline/project/pipeline,target=/pipeline
# The path "/home/pipeline/project/pipeline/" will need to be manually set up on each system.
# This needs to be an absolute path to the directory that contains the folder "pipeline".
